# Speedy Eats Application 
Application developed in C# to manage journey records for delivery drivers. This is a multi-threaded application making use of the Producer/Consumer pattern and LINQ query language. 
Appropriate unit tests have been developed using the Microsoft Testing Framework, to automate the testing  of the functionality of this application. This was developed for my second assignment for my Advanced Software Development module in my Computer Science course.
